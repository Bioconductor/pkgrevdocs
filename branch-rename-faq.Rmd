# Branch Rename FAQs

The _Bioconductor_ project has chosen 'devel' to be the default branch for
GitHub and git repositories. To prepare for this transition, we have compiled a
list of Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs) below.

## What is changing?

The Bioconductor core team will rename the default branch to 'devel' on the
Bioconductor git repository located at <git.bioconductor.org>. All other
repositories including those on repository hosting platforms such as GitHub,
GitLabs, etc. will not be affected by our change. Maintainers and developers
will be responsible for updating their local and cloud git repositories.

## Who is affected by this change?

Bioconductor developers and maintainers are affected by this change.
Bioconductor users are not affected.

## What repositories are affected by this change?

Note that there may exist several clones of a single Bioconductor repository.
The Bioconductor copy of the repository resides at <git.bioconductor.org>.
Bioconductor will only change the default branch on the main copy of the
repository. Maintainers will be responsible for updating the local and cloud
copies of their repositories.

## What do I need to change?

Bioconductor developers will have to rename default branches on their
repositories to 'devel'. This includes GitHub and other local copies of their
repositories.

Bioconductor users will not need to do anything.

## What should my remotes look like?

A proper `git remote` set up should have `origin` set to the GitHub location
and `upstream` set to the Bioconductor git repository. For example, this would
be the set up for `BiocGenerics`:

    git remote -v
    # origin	git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (fetch)
    # origin	git@github.com:Bioconductor/BiocGenerics (push)
    # upstream	git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (fetch)
    # upstream	git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics (push)

## How do I sync my remotes? {.tabset .tabset-face .tabset-pills}

### before 

Before making updates to branches, make sure that both remotes `origin` and
`upstream` are in sync:

    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git pull upstream master

### after

Before making updates to branches, make sure that both remotes `origin` and
`upstream` are in sync:

    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git pull upstream devel:master

## How do I set 'devel' as the default local branch? {.tabset .tabset-face .tabset-pills}

### before

**Scenario**: Synchronize the local repository **before** the Bioconductor
branch rename transition. Note, make sure that both `origin` and `upstream` are
sync'ed to each other.

    ## IMPORTANT!
    git checkout master
    git pull origin master
    git pull upstream master
    ## Make sure local devel branch does not already exist
    git branch -d devel
    ## Create and push the devel branch
    git checkout -b devel

_Note_. If your GitHub default branch is `main`, replace `master` with `main`:

    ## IMPORTANT!
    git checkout main
    git pull origin main
    git pull upstream master:main
    ## Make sure local devel branch does not already exist
    git branch -d devel
    ## Create and push the devel branch
    git checkout -b devel

**Caveat**: The changes need to be sync'ed with GitHub.

### after

**Scenario**: Synchronize the local repository **after** the Bioconductor
branch rename transition. Note, make sure that both `origin` and `upstream` are
sync'ed to each other.

    git branch -m master devel
    git fetch upstream
    git branch -u upstream/devel devel
    git remote set-head upstream -a

## How do I set 'devel' as the default branch on GitHub?

The rename operation is possible via GitHub. Go to
<https://github.com/{username}/{repo}/branches> where `username` and `repo`
correspond to your GitHub username and repository, respectively.

Click on the 'edit' pencil to rename the branch (seen here at the bottom right
corner):

```{r,echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_graphics("images/rename_branch_github_screen.png")
```

Once the branch is renamed, use the GitHub commands to update the local
repository:

    git branch -m master devel
    git fetch origin
    git branch -u origin/devel devel
    git remote set-head origin -a

Note. The above reflects adjustments after a 'master' to 'devel' rename.
If you are cloning a repository from <git.bioconductor.org> after the
transition, nothing additional needs to be done (except the sync with GitHub).

## How do I push to Bioconductor? {.tabset .tabset-face .tabset-pills}

### before

To push `upstream` to Bioconductor **before** the transition, the developer can
map branches ad hoc in the `git push` command. The workflow would look similar
to:

    ## branch should already exist
    git checkout devel
    #### <make changes to repository>
    git push upstream devel:master
    
### after

To push `upstream` to Bioconductor **after** the transition, the developer
will not need to map any branches as `devel` will correspond to `devel`, i.e.,:

    ## branch should already exist
    git checkout devel
    #### <make changes to repository>
    git push upstream devel
