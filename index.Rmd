## Introduction {.unnumbered #intro}


The [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) project promotes high-quality, well documented, and interoperable software.
These guidelines help to achieve this objective; they are not meant to put undue burden on package authors, and authors having difficultly satisfying guidelines should seek advice on the [bioc-devel](https://bioconductor.org/help/support/) mailing list.

Package maintainers are urged to follow these guidelines as closely as possible when developing [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) packages.

General instructions for producing R packages can be found in the [Writing R Extensions](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/R-exts.html) manual, available from within <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> (`RShowDoc("R-exts")`) or on the [R web site](http://cran.fhcrc.org/manuals.html).

Remember these are the minimum requirements for package acceptance and the package will still be subject to other guidelines below and a formal technical review by trained [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) package reviewer.
