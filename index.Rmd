## Introduction {.unnumbered #intro}


The [_Bioconductor_][] project promotes high-quality, well documented, and interoperable software.
These guidelines help to achieve this objective; they are not meant to put undue
burden on package authors, and authors having difficultly satisfying guidelines
should seek advice on the [bioc-devel][bioc-devel-mail] mailing list.

Package maintainers are urged to follow these guidelines as closely as possible
when developing [_Bioconductor_][] packages.

General instructions for producing R packages can be found in the [Writing R
Extensions][] manual, available from within <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>
(`RShowDoc("R-exts")`) or on the [R website][].

Remember these are the minimum requirements for package acceptance and the
package will still be subject to other guidelines below and a formal technical
review by trained [_Bioconductor_ package reviewer][reviewer-list] .


## Contribute {.unnumbered}

This book is open-source and hosted at <https://github.com/Bioconductor/pkgrevdocs>.
