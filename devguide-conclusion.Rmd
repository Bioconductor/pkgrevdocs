# Conclusion {#conclusion}

The exercise [How to a Build Bioconductor Package with RStudio](http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/buildingPackagesForBioc/) may also be helpful.

Remember that every [_Bioconductor_][] package goes through a formal review
process and may still receive technical feedback from the assigned
[_Bioconductor_ reviewer][reviewer-list].

An overview of the submission process may be found in the [previous
section](#subintro) and a package may be submitted to the
[GitHub package submission repository][tracker].

Thank you for reading these guidelines, and welcome to the [_Bioconductor_][]
community of users and developers!
