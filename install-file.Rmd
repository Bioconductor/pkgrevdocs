# The INSTALL file {#sysdep}

An INSTALL file does not have to be included with the package. An INSTALL file
is utilized for specifying external system requirements needed. It should be
used in combination with the `SystemRequirements` field of the [Description
file](#description). This file should contain installation instructions for the
required system dependency.

Specifying this requirement does not guarantee that _Bioconductor_ will agree to
install the external system requirement. It is encourage to discuss any
additional system requirements on the bioc-devel@r-project.org before
development.

System requirements should never be exclusive to a particular
version. Maintainers are expected to have their package work with whatever the
current version of external software is available.
