## README file {#readme}

If a `README` file is included in the package or the <i class="fab fa-github"></i> Github  repository and it provides installation instructions, those instruction should also include [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) installation instructions.

If a `README.Rmd` is provided (rather than `README.md`, or other) those installation instructions should be in an `eval=FALSE` code chunk.

Nowhere in the code (<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> code, man pages, vignettes, Rmd files) should someone try to install or download system dependencies, applications, packages, etc.

Developers can provide instructions to follow but not executed and should assume all necessary dependencies, applications, or packages are already set up on a user's system.
