# Package data {#data}

When developing a software package, an excellent practice is to give a comprehensive illustration of the methods in the package using an existing [experiment data package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/BiocViews.html#___ExperimentData), annotation data or data in the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` or `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")`, or submitting new data to those resources yourself.

If existing data is not available or applicable, or a new smaller dataset is needed for examples in the package, data can be included either as a separate data package (for larger amounts of data) or within the package (for smaller datasets).

The Bioconductor Build system does not support git-lfs.  This is not a current
option for storing large data. Large data sets must be included through the [ExperimentHub](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ExperimentHub/inst/doc/CreateAnExperimentHubPackage.html).

## Experiment Data Package

Experimental data packages contain data specific to a particular analysis or experiment.
They often accompany a software package for use in the examples and vignettes and in general are not updated regularly. If you need a general subset of data for workflows or examples first check the `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")` resource for available files (e.g., BAM, FASTA, BigWig, etc.).

[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) strongly encourages creating an
experiment data package that utilizes `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("ExperimentHub")` or
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")` (See [Creating an Experiment Hub
Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ExperimentHub/inst/doc/CreateAnExperimentHubPackage.html)
or [Creating an Annotation Hub
Package](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/AnnotationHub/inst/doc/CreateAnAnnotationPackage.html))
but a traditional package that encapsulates the data is also acceptable.

See the [Package Submission guidelines](https://www.bioconductor.org/developers/package-submission/) for submitting related packages.

## Adding Data to Existing Package

[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) strongly encourages the use of existing datasets, but if not available data can be included directly in the package for use in the examples found in man pages, vignettes, and tests of your package.
This is a good reference by [Hadley Wickham about data](http://r-pkgs.had.co.nz/data.html).

However, as mentioned in [The DESCRIPTION file](the-description-file.html#lazydata) chapter, [_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) does not encourage using `LazyData: True` despite its recommendataion in this article.

Some key points are summarized in the following sections.

### Exported Data and the `data/` directory

Data in `data/` is exported to the user and readily available.
It is made available in an <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> session through the use of `data()`.
It will require documentation concerning its creation and source information.
It is most often a `.RData` file created with `save()` but other types are acceptable as well, see `?data()`.

Please remember to compress the data.

### Raw Data and the `inst/extdata/` directory

It is often desirable to show a workflow which involves the parsing or loading of raw files.
[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) recommends finding existing raw data already provided in another package or the hubs.

However, if this is not applicable, raw data files should be included in the `inst/extdata` directory.
Files of these type are often accessed utilizing `system.file()`.
[_Bioconductor_](https://bioconductor.org/) requires documentation on these files in an `inst/script/` directory.

### Internal data

Rarely, a package may require parsed data that is used internal but should not be exported to the user.
An `R/sysdata.rda` is often the best place to include this type of data.

### Other data

Downloads of files and external data from the web should be avoided.

If it is necessary, at minimum the files should be cached.
See `r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocFileCache")` for Bioconductor recommended package for caching of files.
If a maintainer creates their own caching directory, it should utilize standard
caching directories `tools::R_user_dir(package, which="cache")`. It is not
allowed to download or write any files to a users home directory or working
directory. Files should be cached as stated above with `BiocFileCache` (preferred)
or `R_user_dir` or `tempdir()/tempfile()` if files should not be persistent.
