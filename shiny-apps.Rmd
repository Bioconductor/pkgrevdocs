# Shiny apps {#shiny}

[Shiny apps][shiny-rstudio] can be submitted to _Bioconductor_ as software packages.

## Code organisation

Shiny apps are divided into two parts:

- User interface (UI)
- Server

Shiny apps submitted to _Bioconductor_ must store the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> code
for the UI and server code under the `R/` directory of the package.

The bulk of the package code should **not** be implemented within the Shiny app directly.
