# General _Bioconductor_ Package Development {#general}

## Version of _Bioconductor_ and <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>

Package developers should always use the [devel version of _Bioconductor_]['devel' version] and
[_Bioconductor_ packages][biocViews] when developing and testing packages to be contributed.

Depending on the <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> release cycle, using
[_Bioconductor_][] devel may or may not involve also using the devel version of
<i class="fab fa-r-project"></i>. See the how-to on [using devel version of
Bioconductor]['devel' version] for up-to-date information.

## Correctness, Space and Time {#correctness-space-and-time}

### R CMD build {#r-cmd-build}

[_Bioconductor_][] packages must minimally pass `R CMD build` (or `R CMD INSTALL
--build`) and pass `R CMD check` with no errors and no warnings using a recent
R-devel. Authors should also try to address all errors, warnings, and notes that
arise during build or check.

### BiocCheck {#bioccheck}

Packages must also pass `BiocCheck::BiocCheckGitClone()` and
`BiocCheck::BiocCheck('new-package'=TRUE)` with no errors and no warnings. The
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("BiocCheck")` package is a set of tests that encompass
[_Bioconductor_][] Best Practices. Every effort should be made to address any
errors, warnings, and notes that arise during this build or check.

### ERROR, WARNING, and NOTES {#error-warning-and-notes}

The [_Bioconductor_][] team member assigned to review
the package during the submission process will expect all ERROR, WARNINGS, and
NOTES to be addressed from both R CMD build, R CMD check, and BiocCheck. If
there are any remaining, a justification of why they are not corrected will be
expected.


### File names {#file-names}

Do not use filenames that differ only in case, as not all file systems are case-sensitive.

### Package size {#package-size}

The source package resulting from running `R CMD build` should occupy less than 5 MB on disk.
If your package includes (e.g. in the vignettes) some screenshots, this limit can be reached quite quickly. Their size can be reduced (often as much as 70%) in a lossy but quality-preserving manner by using tools such as [pngquant](https://pngquant.org/) (available as a command line utility and as a GUI on most systems).

### Check duration {#check-duration}

The package should require less than 10 minutes to run `R CMD check --no-build-vignettes`.
Using the `--no-build-vignettes` option ensures that the vignette is built only once.
^[This is true only for Software Packages.
Experiment Data, Annotation, and Workflow packages are allowed additional space and check time.]

### Memory {#memory}

Vignette and man page examples should not use more than 3 GB of memory since <i class="fab fa-r-project"></i> cannot allocate more than this on 32-bit Windows.

### Individual file size {#individual-file-size}

For software packages, individual files must be <= 5MB.
This restriction exists even after the package is accepted and added to the
[_Bioconductor_][] repository. See [data section](#data) for
advice on packages using large data files. 

### Undesirable files {#undesirable-files}

The raw package directory should not contain unnecessary files, system files, or
hidden files such as `.DS_Store`, `.project`, `.git`, cache files, log files,
`*.Rproj`, `*.so`, etc. These files may be present in your local directory but should not be commited to
git (see [`.gitignore`]{#gitignore}). Any files or directories for other
applications (Github Actions, devtool, etc) should ideally be in a different
branch and not submitted to the _Bioconductor_ version of the package. 

## R CMD check environment {#r-cmd-check-environment}

It is possible to activate or deactivate a number of options in `R CMD build` and `R CMD check`.
Options can be set as individual environment variables or they can be [listed in a file](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Checking-and-building-packages).
Descriptions of all the different options available can be found [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-devel/R-ints.html#Tools).
[_Bioconductor_][] has chosen to customize some of these options for incoming submission during `R CMD check`.
The file of utilized flags can be downloaded from [<i class="fab fa-github"></i> GitHub](https://github.com/Bioconductor/packagebuilder/blob/master/check.Renviron).
The file can either be placed in a default directory as directed [here](https://cran.r-project.org/doc/manuals/r-release/R-exts.html#Checking-and-building-packages) or can be set through environment variable `R_CHECK_ENVIRON` with a command similar to:

```{bash, eval=FALSE}
export R_CHECK_ENVIRON = <path to downloaded file>
```
