# (PART) Package Reviewer Resources {-}

# Overview {.unnumbered #reviewer-resources-overview}

The following sections contain resources for package reviewers and those
interested in becoming package reviewers. You will find reviewer expectations,
useful tools, and how to volunteer to be a community reviewer.

We also encourage communication and conversation on any package review from the
community in addition to assigned reviewers: [Packages Under Review][]. All
package reviews are publicly accessible, therefore any feedback and interactions on
submitted packages must abide by the Bioconductor [Code of Conduct][].
