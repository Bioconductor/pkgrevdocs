# Git Version Control

The _Bioconductor_ project is maintained in a Git source control
system. Package maintainers update their packages by pushing changes
to their git repositories.

This chapter contains several sections that will cover typical scenarios
encountered when adding and maintaining a Bioconductor package.

## Essential work flow

A minimal workflow is to checkout, update, commit, and push changes to
your repository. Using `BiocGenerics` as an example:

    git clone git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics
    cd BiocGenerics
    ## add a file, e.g., `touch README`
    ## edit file, e.g., `vi DESCRIPTION`
    BiocGenerics$ git commit README DESCRIPTION
    BiocGenerics$ git push

This requires that _Bioconductor_ knows the SSH keys you use to
establish your identity.

Two useful commands are

    BiocGenerics$ git diff     # review changes prior to commit
    BiocGenerics$ git log      # review recent commits

If the repository is already cloned, the work flow is to make sure
that you are on the 'master' branch, pull any changes, then introduce
your edits.

    BiocGenerics$ git checkout master
    BiocGenerics$ git pull
    ## add, edit, commit, and push as above

## Where to Commit Changes

New features and bug fixes are introduced on the master ('devel')
branch of the GIT repository.

    BiocGenerics$ git checkout master
    BiocGenerics$ git pull
    ## edit 'R/foo.R' and commit on master
    BiocGenerics$ git commit R/foo.R  #
    [master c955179] your commit message
    1 file changed, 10 insertions(+), 3 deletions(-)
    BiocGenerics$ git push

To make more extensive changes see [Fix bugs in devel and release][].

Bug fixes can be ported to the current release branch. Use
`cherry-pick` to identify the commmit(s) you would like to port. E.g.,
for release 3.6, porting the most recent commit to master

    BiocGenerics$ git checkout RELEASE_3_6
    BiocGenerics$ git cherry-pick master
    BiocGenerics$ git push

## Checks and version bumps

Each commit pushed to the _Bioconductor_ repository should build and
check without errors or warnings

    BiocGenerics$ cd ..
    R CMD build BiocGenerics
    R CMD check BiocGenerics_1.22.3.tar.gz

Each commit, in either release or devel, should include a bump in the
`z` portion of the `x.y.z` package [versioning scheme][versioning].

Builds occur once per day, and take approximately 24 hours. See the
[build report][devel-software-build-report] for git commits captured in the most recent build
(upper left corner)


## Annotation packages

Traditional Annotation packages are not stored in GIT due to the size of
annotation files. To update an existing Annotation package please send an email
to maintainer@bioconductor.org. A member of the Bioconductor team will be in
contact to receive the updated package.

Newer annotation packages can be stored in GIT as it is a requirement to use the
`r BiocStyle::Biocpkg("AnnotationHub")` server hosted data. The larger sized
files are not included directly in the package. To contribute a new Annotation
package please contact hubs@bioconductor.org for guidance and read the
documentation on [Create A Hub Package][].

Currently direct updates to annotation packages, even those stored on git, are
not supported. If you wish to updated an annotation package, make required
changes and push to git.bioconductor.org. Then send an email to
hubs@bioconductor.org or maintainer@bioconductor.org requesting the package be propagated.

## Subversion to Git Transition

The essential steps for transitioning from SVN to git are summarized
in

- [New package workflow][]: update your GitHub repository after
  package acceptance.
- [Create a new GitHub repository][] for an existing package.
- [Maintain a _Bioconductor_-only repository][] for an existing
  package.


### New package workflow

__Goal__: You developed a package in GitHub, following the
_Bioconductor_ new package [Contributions README][tracker] guidelines,
[submitted it to _Bioconductor_](#bioconductor-package-submissions), and your package has been
moderated. As part of moderation process, the package to be reviewed
has been added as a repository on the [_Bioconductor_ git server][git].

During and after the review process, package authors must push changes
that include a **version number 'bump'** to the _Bioconductor_ git
repository. This causes the package to be built and checked on Linux,
macOS, and Windows operating systems, and forms the basis for the
review process.

In this document, package authors will learn best practices for
pushing to the _Bioconductor_ git repository.

1. **SSH keys**. As part of the initial moderation step,
   _Bioconductor_ will use SSH 'public key' keys available in
   `https://github.com/<your-github-id>.keys`.

   After the review process is over, additional SSH keys can be added
   and contact information edited using the [BiocCredentials
   application][].

1. **Configure the "remotes" of your local git repository**. You will need
   to push any future changes to your package to the _Bioconductor_ git
   repository to issue a new build of your package.

   Add a remote named `upstream` to your package's local git
   repository using:

        git remote add upstream git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME>.git

   Check that you have updated the remotes in your repository; you'll
   see an `origin` remote pointing to `github.com`, and an `upstream` remote
   pointing to `bioconductor.org`

        $ git remote -v

        origin  <link to your github> (fetch)
        origin  <link to your github> (push)
        upstream git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME>.git (fetch)
        upstream git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<YOUR-REPOSITORY-NAME>.git (push)

   NOTE: As a package developer, you must use the SSH protocol (as in
   the above command) to gain read/write access to your package in the
   _Bioconductor_ git repository.

1. **Add and commit changes to your local repository**. During the
   review process you will likely need to update your package. Do this
   in your local repository by first making sure your repository is
   up-to-date with your `github.com` and `git.bioconductor.org`
   repositories.

        git fetch --all

        ## merge changes from Bioc (upstream remote at git@git.bioconductor.org)
        git merge upstream/master

        ## merge changes from GitHub (origin remote)
        git merge origin/master

   **Note**. If your GitHub default branch is `main`, replace `master` with
        `main`:

        ## merge changes from GitHub (origin remote)
        git merge origin/main

   Make changes to your package master branch and commit them to your
   local repository

        git add <files changed>
        git commit -m "<informative commit message>"

1. **'Bump' the package version**.  Your package version number is in
   the format 'major.minor.patch'. Initial package submissions should have
   a version number of `0.99.0`, as indicated by the `Version` field in the
   `DESCRIPTION` file. Increment the `patch` version number by 1, e.g., to
   `0.99.1`, `0.99.2`, ..., `0.99.9`, `0.99.10`, ...

   Bumping the version number before pushing is essential. It ensures
   that the package is built across platforms.

   Remember to add and commit these changes to your local repository.

1. **Push changes to the Bioconductor and GitHub repositories**.  Push
   the changes in your local repository to the _Bioconductor_ and
   GitHub repositories.

        ## push to BioC (upstream remote at git@git.bioconductor.org)
        git push upstream master

        ## push to GitHub (origin remote)
        git push origin master

   **Note**. If your GitHub default branch is `main`, replace `master` with
        `main`:

        ## push to Bioc (upstream remote at git@git.bioconductor.org)
        git push upstream main:master

        ## push to GitHub (origin remote)
        git push origin main

1. **Check the updated build report**. If your push to
   git.bioconductor.org included a version bump, you'll receive an
   email directing you to visit your issue on github.com,
   `https://github.com/Bioconductor/Contributions/issues/`; a comment
   is also posted on the issue indicating that a build has started.

   After several minutes a second email and comment will indicate that
   the build has completed, and that the build report is
   available. The comment includes a link to the build report. Follow
   the link to see whether further changes are necessary.

1. See other scenarios for working with _Bioconductor_ and GitHub repositories, in particular:

    - [Maintain GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories][].
    - [Fix bugs in  devel and release][].
    - [Resolve merge conflicts][mergeconflict].

### Create a new GitHub repository for an existing _Bioconductor_ package {#maintain-github-bioc}

__Goal:__ As a maintainer, you'd like to create a new GitHub
repository for your existing _Bioconductor_ repository, so that your
user community can engage in the development of your package.

1.  [Create a new GitHub account][] if you don't have one.

1.  Set up remote access to GitHub via SSH or Https.  Please check
    [which-remote-url-should-i-use][] and
    [add your public key to your GitHub account][].

1.  Once you have submitted your keys, you can login to the
    [BiocCredentials application][] to check if the correct
    keys are on file with _Bioconductor_.

1.  [Create a new GitHub repo][] on your account, with the name
    of the existing _Bioconductor_ package.

    We use "BiocGenerics" as an example for this scenario.

    ```{r,echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/create_repo.png")
    ```

    After pressing the 'Create repository' button, __ignore__ the
    instructions that GitHub provides, and follow the rest of this
    document.

1.  On your local machine, clone the empty repository from GitHub.

    Use `https` URL (replace `<developer>` with your GitHub username)

        git clone https://github.com/<developer>/BiocGenerics.git

    or `SSH` URL

        git clone git@github.com:<developer>/BiocGenerics.git

1.  Add a remote to your cloned repository.

    Change the current working directory to your local repository
    cloned in the previous step.

        cd BiocGenerics
        git remote add upstream git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics.git

1.  Fetch content from remote upstream,

        git fetch upstream

1.  Merge upstream with origin's master branch,

        git merge upstream/master

    __NOTE:__ If you have the error `fatal: refusing to merge
    unrelated histories`, then the repository cloned in step 4 was not
    empty. Either clone an empty repository, or see
    [Sync existing repositories][].

1. Push changes to your origin master,

        git push origin master

    __NOTE:__ Run the command `git config --global push.default
    matching` to always push local branches to the remote branch of
    the same name, allowing use of `git push origin` rather than `git
    push origin master`.

1.  (Optional) Add a branch to GitHub,

        ## Fetch all updates
        git fetch upstream

        ## Checkout new branch RELEASE_3_6, from upstream/RELEASE_3_6
        git checkout -b RELEASE_3_6 upstream/RELEASE_3_6

        ## Push updates to remote origin's new branch RELEASE_3_6
        git push -u origin RELEASE_3_6

1. Check your GitHub repository to confirm that the `master` (and
   optionally `RELEASE_3_6`) branches are present.

1. Once the GitHub repository is established follow
   [Push to GitHub and _Bioconductor_][] to maintain your repository
   on both GitHub and Bioconductor.

### Maintain a _Bioconductor_-only repository for an existing package {#maintain-bioc-only}

__Goal:__ Developer wishes to maintain their _Bioconductor_ repository
without using GitHub.

#### Clone and setup the package on your local machine.

1. Make sure that you have `SSH` access to the _Bioconductor_
   repository; be sure to [submit your SSH public key][BiocCredentials application] or
   github id to _Bioconductor_.

1. Clone the package to your local machine,

        git clone git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<ExamplePackage>

    __NOTE:__ If you clone with `https` you will NOT get read+write
    access.

1. View existing remotes

        git remote -v

    which will display

        origin    git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<ExamplePackage>.git (fetch)
        origin    git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<ExamplePackage>.git (push)

    This indicates that your git repository has only one remote
    `origin`, which is the _Bioconductor_ repository.

1. In other work flows, the `origin` remote has been renamed to
   `upstream`. It may be convenient to make this change to your own
   repository

        git remote rename origin upstream

    and confirm that `git remote -v` now associates the `upstream`
    repository name with `git@git.bioconductor.org`.

#### Commit changes to your local repository

1. Before making changes to your repository, make sure to `pull`
   changes or updates from the _Bioconductor_ repository. This is
   needed to avoid conflicts.

        git pull

1. Make the required changes, then `add` and `commit` your changes to
   your `master` branch.

        git add <files changed>
        git commit -m "My informative commit message"

1. (Alternative) If the changes are non-trivial, create a new branch
   where you can easily abandon any false starts. Merge the final
   version onto `master`

        git checkout -b feature-my-feature
        ## add and commit to this branch. When the change is complete...
        git checkout master
        git merge feature-my-feature

#### Push your local commits to the _Bioconductor_ repository

1. Push your commits to the _Bioconductor_ repository to make them
   available to the user community.

   Push changes to the `master` branch using:

        git checkout master
        git push upstream master

Make sure there is a valid version bump for the changes to propagate to users.

#### (Optional) Merge changes to the current release branch

Merging master into release branch should be avoided. Select bug fixes should be
cherry-picked from master to release. See section [Bug Fixes in Release and Devel](#bug-fix-in-release-and-devel)


## More scenarios for repository creation

- [Sync an existing GitHub repository][Sync existing repositories] with _Bioconductor_.
- [Create a local repository][] for private use.


### Sync an existing GitHub repository with _Bioconductor_ {#sync-existing-repositories}

__Goal:__ Ensure that your local, _Bioconductor_, and GitHub
repositories are all in sync.

1. Clone the GitHub repository to a local machine. Change into the
   directory containing the repository.

1. Configure the "remotes" of the GitHub clone.

        git remote add upstream git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/<YOUR-REPOSITORY>.git

1. Fetch updates from all (_Bioconductor_ and GitHub) remotes. You may
   see "warning: no common commits"; this will be addressed after
   resolving conflicts, below.

        git fetch --all

1. Make sure you are on the master branch.

        git checkout master

1. Merge updates from the GitHub (`origin`) remote

        git merge origin/master

1. Merge updates from the _Bioconductor_ (`upstream`) remote

        git merge upstream/master

   Users of git version >= 2.9 will see an error message ("fatal:
   refusing to merge unrelated histories") and need to use

        git merge --allow-unrelated-histories upstream/master

1. [Resolve merge conflicts][mergeconflict] if necessary.

1. After resolving conflicts and committing changes, look for duplicate
   commits (e.g., `git log --oneline | wc` returns twice as many
   commits as in SVN) and consider following the steps to
   [force Bioconductor `master` to GitHub `master`][force-bioc-to-github].

1. Push to both _Bioconductor_  and GitHub repositories.

        git push upstream master
        git push origin master

1. Repeat for the release branch, replacing `master` with the name of
   the release branch, e.g., `RELEASE_3_6`. It may be necessary to
   create the release branch in the local repository.

        git checkout RELEASE_3_6
        git merge upstream/RELEASE_3_6
        git merge origin/RELEASE_3_6
        git push upstream RELEASE_3_6
        git push origin RELEASE_3_6

    NOTE: If you are syncing your release branch for the first time,
    you have to make a local copy of the `RELEASE_X_Y` branch, by

        git checkout -b <RELEASE_X_Y> upstream/<RELEASE_X_Y>

    Following this one time local checkout, you may switch between
    `RELEASE_X_Y` and `master` with `git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>`. If you do
    not use the command to get a local copy of the release branch, you
    will get the message,

       (HEAD detached from origin/RELEASE_X_Y)


   Remember that only `master` and the current release branch of
   _Bioconductor_ repositories can be updated.


### Create a local repository for private use {#create-local-repository}

__Goal:__ A user (not the package developer) would like to modify
functions in a package to meet their needs. There is no GitHub
repository for the package.

1. Clone the package from the _Bioconductor_ repository. As an end
   user, you do not have write access to the repository, so use the
   __https__ protocol

        git clone https://git@git.bioconductor.org/packages/<ExamplePackage>

1. Make changes to your local repository. Commit the changes to your
   local repository. A best practice might modify the changes in a new
   branch

        git checkout -b feature-my-feature
        ## modify
        git commit -a -m "feature: a new feature"

   and then merge the feature onto the branch corresponding to the
   release in use, e.g.,

        git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>
        git merge feature-my-feature

1. Rebuild (to create the vignette and help pages) and reinstall the
   package in your local machine by running in the parent directory of
   _ExamplePackage_

        R CMD build ExamplePackage
        R CMD INSTALL ExamplePackage_<version.number>.tar.gz

1. The package with the changes should be available in your local _R_
   installation.

## Scenarios for code update:

- [Pull upstream changes][], e.g., introduced by the core team.
- [Push to GitHub and _Bioconductor_][] repositories.
- [Resolve merge conflicts][mergeconflict].
- [Abandon changes][].
- [Fix bugs in  devel and release][].
- [Resolve duplicate commits][]


### Pull upstream changes

__Goal:__ Your _Bioconductor_ repository has been updated by the core
team. You want to fetch these commits from _Bioconductor_, merge them
into your local repository, and push them to GitHub.

__NOTE:__ It is always a good idea to fetch updates from
_Bioconductor_ before making more changes. This will help prevent
merge conflicts.

These steps update the `master` branch.

1. Make sure you are on the appropriate branch.

        git checkout master

1. Fetch content from _Bioconductor_

        git fetch upstream

1. Merge upstream with the appropriate local branch

        git merge upstream/master

    Get help on [Resolve merge conflicts][mergeconflict] if these occur.

1. If you also maintain a GitHub repository, push changes to GitHub's
   (`origin`) `master` branch

        git push origin master

To pull updates to the current `RELEASE_X_Y` branch, replace `master`
with `RELEASE_X_Y` in the lines above.

See instructions to [Sync existing repositories][] with
changes to both the _Bioconductor_ and GitHub repositories.


### Push to GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories {#push-to-github-bioc}

__Goal:__ During everyday development, you commit changes to your
local repository `master` branch, and wish to push these commits to
both GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories.

__NOTE:__ See [Pull upstream changes][] for best practices before
committing local changes.

1. We assume you already have a GitHub repository with the right setup
   to push to _Bioconductor_'s git server
   (git@git.bioconductor.org). If not please see FAQ's on how to get
   access and follow instructions to
   [Maintain GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories][]. We use a clone
   of the `BiocGenerics` package in the following example.

1.  To check that remotes are set up properly, run the command inside
	your local machine's clone.

		git remote -v

	which should produce the result (where &#60;developer&#62; is your GitHub
	username):

		origin  git@github.com:<developer>/BiocGenerics.git (fetch)
		origin  git@github.com:<developer>/BiocGenerics.git (push)
		upstream    git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics.git (fetch)
		upstream    git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/BiocGenerics.git (push)

1. Make and commit changes to the `master` branch

		git checkout master
		## edit files, etc.
		git add <name of file changed>
		git commit -m "My informative commit message describing the change"

1. (Alternative) When changes are more elaborate, best practice is to
   use a local branch for development.

		git checkout master
		git checkout -b feature-my-feature
		## multiple rounds of edit, add, commit

	Merge the local branch to master when the feature is 'complete'.

		git checkout master

		# Pull upstream changes before merging
		# http://bioconductor.org/developers/how-to/git/pull-upstream-changes/

		git merge feature-my-feature

1. Push updates to GitHub's (`origin`) `master` branch

		git push origin master

1.  Next, push updates to _Bioconductor_'s (`upstream`) `master` branch

		git push upstream master

1. Confirm changes, e.g., by visiting the GitHub web page for the repository.


### Resolve merge conflicts {#resolve-merge-conflicts}

__Goal:__ Resolve merge conflicts in branch and push to GitHub and
_Bioconductor_ repositories.

1. You will know you have a merge conflict when you see something like
   this:

        git merge upstream/master
        Auto-merging DESCRIPTION
        CONFLICT (content): Merge conflict in DESCRIPTION
        Automatic merge failed; fix conflicts and then commit the result

    This merge conflict occurs when the package developer makes a
    change, and also a collaborator or a _Bioconductor_ core team
    member makes a change to the same file (in this case the
    `DESCRIPTION` file).

    How can you avoid this? [Pull upstream changes][] before
    committing any changes. In other words, `fetch` and `merge` remote
    branches before a `push`.

1. If in spite of this you have conflicts, you need to fix them. See
   which file has the conflict,

        git status

    This will show you something like this:

	    On branch master
	    Your branch is ahead of 'origin/master' by 1 commit.
          (use "git push" to publish your local commits)
	    You have un-merged paths.
	      (fix conflicts and run "git commit")
	      (use "git merge --abort" to abort the merge)

	    Un-merged paths:
	      (use "git add <file>..." to mark resolution)

          both modified:   DESCRIPTION

	    no changes added to commit (use "git add" and/or "git commit -a")

1. Open the file in your favorite editor. Conflicts look like:

	    <<<<<<< HEAD
	    Version: 0.23.2
	    =======
        Version: 0.23.3
	    >>>>>>> upstream/master

	Everything between `<<<<` and `=====` refers to HEAD, i.e your
    current change. And everything between `=====` and `>>>>>` refers
    to the `remote/branch` shown there, i.e `upstream/master`.

	You want to keep the most accurate change, by deleting what is
    necessary. In this case, keep the latest version:

        Version: 0.23.3

1. Add and commit the file as you would any other change.

	    git add DESCRIPTION
	    git commit -m "Fixed conflicts in version change"

1. 	Push to both your GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories,

	    git push origin master
	    git push upstream master

### Abandon changes

__Goal:__ You want to start fresh after failing to resolve conflicts
or some other issue. If you intend to go nuclear, please contact the
bioc-devel@bioconductor.org mailing list.

#### Force _Bioconductor_ `master` to GitHub `master`

One way you can ignore your work and make a new branch is by replacing
your local and GitHub repository `master` branch with the
_Bioconductor_ `master` branch.

__Note__: This works only if you haven't pushed the change causing the
issue to the _Bioconductor_ repository.

__Note__: Any references to commits on current master (e.g., in GitHub
issues) will be invalidated.

1. Checkout a new branch, e.g., `master_backup`, with tracking set to
   track the _Bioconductor_ `master` branch `upstream/master`.

        git checkout -b master_backup upstream/master

1. Rename the branches you currently have on your local
   machine. First, rename `master` to `master_deprecated`. Second,
   rename `master_backup` to `master`. This process is called the
   classic __Switcheroo__.

        git branch -m master master_deprecated
        git branch -m master_backup master

1. You will now have to "force push" the changes to your GitHub
   (`origin`) `master` branch.

        git push -f origin master

1. __(Optional)__ If you have commits on your `master_deprecated`
   branch that you would like ported on to your new `master`
   branch. Git has a special feature called `cherry-pick`

   Take a look at which commit you want to cherry-pick on to the new
   master branch, using `git log master_deprecated`, copy the correct
   commit id, and use:

        git cherry-pick <commit id>

   Push these cherry-picked changes to GitHub and _Bioconductor_
   repositories.

#### Reset to a previous commit

If you find yourself in a place where you want to abandon changes
__already committed__ to _Bioconductor_ or GitHub, use `reset` to undo
the commits on your local repository and `push -f` to force the
changes to the remotes. Remember that the `HEAD` commit id is the most
recent __parent__ commit of the current state of your local
repository.

    git reset --hard <commit id>

Example:

    git reset --hard e02e4d86812457fd9fdd43adae5761f5946fdfb3
    HEAD is now at e02e4d8 version bump by bioc core

To make the changes permanent, you will then need to push the changes
to GitHub, and then email the Bioconductor core team to force push to
the repository on Bioconductor.

	## You

	git push -f origin

Bioconductor core team will do the rest after you email.

#### Delete your local copy and GitHub repo, because nothing is working

__CAUTION: These instructions come with many disadvantages. You have
been warned.__

1. Delete your local repository, e.g., `rm -rf BiocGenerics`

1. Delete (or rename) your GitHub repository.

1. [Maintain GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories][] for an existing
   _Bioconductor_ repository, then [Pull upstream changes][].

##### Disadvantages of going "nuclear"

1. You will lose all your GitHub issues

1. You will lose your custom collaborator settings in GitHub.

1. You will lose any GitHub-specific changes.


### Fix bugs in `devel` and  `release` {#bug-fix-in-release-and-devel}

__Goal:__ When a bug is present in both the release and devel branches of
Bioconductor, a maintainer will have to introduce a patch in the default
git branch and in the current release branch (e.g., `RELEASE_3_14`).

1. First [Sync existing repositories][].

        git fetch --all
        git checkout master
        git merge upstream/master
        git merge origin/master
        git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>
        git merge upstream/<RELEASE_X_Y>
        git merge origin/<RELEASE_X_Y>

1. On your local machine, be sure that you are on the `master` branch.

        git checkout master

   Make the changes needed to fix the bug and add the modified files
   to the commit. Remember to bump the version number in the `DESCRIPTION` file
   __in a separate commit__. Only bug-fix changes should be introduced in this
   commit.

        git add <files changed>

   Commit the modified files. It is helpful to tag the commit message with "bug
   fix".

        git commit -m "bug fix: my bug fix"

   Bump the version of the package by editing the `Version` field in the
   `DESCRIPTION` and commit the change __in a separate commit__. This allows to
   only `cherry-pick` the bug correction and avoid version number conflicts with
   the Bioconductor branches when/if the bug fixes are ported to release. 

        ## after version bump
        git add DESCRIPTION
        git commit -m "version bump in devel"

1. (Alternative) If the changes are non-trivial i.e., with multiple commits,
   create a new branch where you can easily abandon any false starts.

        git checkout master
        git checkout -b bugfix-my-bug
        ## add and commit to this branch to fix the bug

   Merge the final version of the branch into the default branch.

        git checkout master
        git merge bugfix-my-bug

1. Switch to the release branch and `cherry-pick` the commit hash or range of
   hashes from the default branch that correspond to the bug fix (more examples
   in `git cherry-pick --help`). Remember to edit the `DESCRIPTION` file to
   update the release version of the package according to _Bioconductor_'s
   [version numbering scheme][versioning].

        git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>
        ## example hash from git log: 2644710
        git cherry-pick <hash>
        ## Bump the version and commit the change
        git add DESCRIPTION
        git commit -m "version bump in release"

    __NOTE__: If you are patching your release for the first time, you have to
    make a local copy of the RELEASE_X_Y branch with

        git checkout -b <RELEASE_X_Y> upstream/<RELEASE_X_Y>

    Following this one time local checkout, you may switch between RELEASE_X_Y
    and master with `git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>`. If you do not use the command
    to get a local checkout of the release branch, you will get the message:

        (HEAD detached from origin/RELEASE_X_Y)

1. Push your changes to both the GitHub and _Bioconductor_ `master`
   and `<RELEASE_X_Y>` branches. Make sure you are on the correct
   branch on your local machine.

   For the `master` branch,

        git checkout master
        git push upstream master
        git push origin master

   For the `release` branch,

        git checkout <RELEASE_X_Y>
        git push upstream <RELEASE_X_Y>
        git push origin <RELEASE_X_Y>

### Resolve Duplicate Commits

__Goal:__ You want to get rid of the duplicate (or triplicate) commits
in your git commit history.

Before you begin [Update your package][mergeconflict] to the existing version on
Bioconductor.


#### Steps:

1. **IMPORTANT** Make a backup of the branch with duplicate commits,
   call this `master_backup` (or `RELEASE_3_7_backup`). The name of
   the back up branch should be identifiable and specific to the
   branch you are trying to fix (i.e if you want to fix the *master*
   branch or some `<RELEASE_X_Y>` branch).

   On master, (make sure you are on master by `git checkout master`)

		git branch master_backup


2. Identify the commit from which the duplicates have
   originated. These commits are more often than not, `merge` commits.

3. Reset your branch to the commit *before* the merge commit.

		git reset —hard <commit_id>

4. Now cherry pick your commits from the `master_backup` branch.

		git cherry-pick <commit_id>

	a. The commits you cherry-pick should be only 1 version of the
    duplicate commit, i.e don’t cherry-pick the same commit twice.

	b. Include the branching and version bump commits in your
    cherry-pick. Make the package history look as normal as possible.

5. (Optional) In some cases, there are conflicts you need to fix for
   the cherry-pick to succeed. Please read the documentation on how
   to [resolve conflicts][mergeconflict]

6. Finally, you would need to contact the bioc-devel mailing list to
   reach the Bioconductor core team to sync your repository with the
   version on Bioconductor.  This is not possible as `--force` pushes
   which alter the git timeline are not possible for maintainers.


#### How to check if your package has duplicate commits

One way is to check the log. You should see the same commit message
with the same changes, but with a different commit ID, if you try

	git log

or

	git log --oneline

#### Script to detect duplicate commits

Run this script written in python to [detect duplicate commits][]
which are specific to Bioconductor repositories.

Usage example:

	python detect_duplicate_commits.py /BiocGenerics 1000

	python detect_duplicate_commits.py <path_to_package> <number of commits to check>'


## Github scenarios

- [Add collaborators and use Github social coding features](#add-collaborators-and-leverage-github-features).
- [Change Package Maintainer](#change-maintainer)
- [Remove Large Data Files and clean git tree](#remove-large-data-files-and-clean-git-tree)

### Add collaborators and leverage GitHub features

__Goal:__ You would like to take advantage of the social coding
features provided by GitHub, while continuing to update your
_Bioconductor_ repository.

#### Maintaining Collaborators on GitHub

1. [Adding a new collaborator][]

2. [Removing collaborator][]

#### Pull requests on GitHub

1. [Merging a pull request][]

#### Push GitHub changes to the _Bioconductor_ repository

Once you have accepted pull requests from your package community on
GitHub, you can push these changes to _Bioconductor_.

1. Make sure that you are on the branch to which the changes were
   applied, for example `master`.

        git checkout master

1. Fetch and merge the GitHub changes to your local repository.

        git fetch origin
        git merge

    [Resolve merge conflicts][mergeconflict] if necessary.

1. Push your local repository to the upstream _Bioconductor_ repository.

        git push upstream master

    To push GitHub release branch updates to the _Bioconductor_
    release branch, replace `master` with name of the release branch,
    e.g.: `RELEASE_3_6`.


### Add or Transfer Maintainership of a Package {#change-maintainer}

__Goal:__ Perhaps there is a point in time where you can no longer maintain your
package in accordance with the Bioconductor package guidelines. It  may be
necessary to add or transfer maintainer-ship of a package in order to properly
maintain the package and avoid deprecation and removal.

1. Find a new maintainer

   You may have a collaborator or colleague volunteer to take over.  If not, ask
   on the [bioc-devel][bioc-devel-mail] mailing list.

2. Email <maintainer@bioconductor.org> or <bioc-devel@r-project.org>

   The original maintainer should email and request that the maintainer of the
   package be updated.  Include the package name and the contact information for
   the new maintainer.

3. Update Package DESCRIPTION file

   The DESCRIPTION file of the package should be updated to the new maintainer
   information and pushed to the Bioconductor git.bioconductor.org repository.

### Remove Large Data Files and Clean Git Tree

__Goal:__ Git remembers. Sometimes large data files are added to git
repository (intentionally or unintentionally) causing the size of the repository
to become large. When this happens, it's not enough to just remove the files.
You also must remove them from the git tree (the repository history), or else
your repository will remain large.

There are a few ways to remove large files from a git history. Here, we'll
outline two options: 1) `git filter-repo`, and 2) the BFG repo cleaner. 
These steps should be run on your local copy and (if necessary) pushed to your
own github repository.

#### Removing Large Files from History with filter-repo

As of 2023, the recommended way is to first locate any large files, and 
then remove them with `git filter-repo`.

1. Identify large files using [this git rev-list script](
https://stackoverflow.com/a/42544963):

```
git rev-list --objects --all \
| git cat-file --batch-check='%(objecttype) %(objectname) %(objectsize) %(rest)' \
| sed -n 's/^blob //p' \
| sort --numeric-sort --key=2 \
| cut -c 1-12,41- \
| $(command -v gnumfmt || echo numfmt) --field=2 --to=iec-i --suffix=B --padding=7 --round=nearest
```

This will list all the objects in your repository, including objects in your
history, in order of file size. Use this to identify the names of files to remove.

2. Remove them with [filter-repo](https://github.com/newren/git-filter-repo).

This is a separate tool that you'll have to install 
(with *e.g.* `pip3 install git-filter-repo`). Then, you can rewrite your repository
history to remove files like this, where `<file-glob>` identifies your files:

```
git filter-repo --path-glob '<file-glob>' --invert-paths
```

For example, to remove all `.RData` files, you could use:

```
git filter-repo --path-glob '*.RData' --invert-paths
```

This command may reset your remotes. Check with `git remote` and
if needed, you can add remotes back in using something like this:

```
git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo_name>
git push --set-upstream origin master --force
```

Finally, we have to push with `--mirror` to reset the remote.

```
git push --force --mirror
```

Now, just notify everyone that they'll have to re-clone the new repository, since 
history has been rewritten, so existing clones will no longer be compatible
with this repo.

#### Removing Large Files from History with BFG repo cleaner

Another option is to use BFG. The steps below assume `origin` is a user-maintained github
repository.

**NOTE:** Anyone that is maintaining the package repository (with a local copy)
  should run steps 1-3.

1. Download [BFG Repo-Cleaner](https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/)

2. Run BFG Repo-Cleaner on your package directory

   In the location of your package, run the following command
   ```
   java -jar <path to download>/bfg-1.13.0.jar --strip-blobs-bigger-than 100M <your
   package>
   ```
   **Note:** The above command would remove any file that is 100Mb or
   larger. Adjust this argument based on the size of the files you are cleaning up
   after. It should be lower than the offending file size.

3. Run clean up
   ```
   cd <your package>
   git reflog expire --expire=now --all && git gc --prune=now --aggressive
   ```

4. Push Changes
   ```
   git push -f origin
   ```

5. Request updates on the git.bioconductor.org repository location.

   The Bioconductor git server does not allow `-f` or to force push to the
   git.bioconductor.org location. Please email <bioc-devel@r-project.org>
   explaining the package has been cleaned for large data files and needs to be
   reset.


## Frequently Asked Question (FAQs) {#faq}

1. I can't access my package.

   You will need to log in to the [BiocCredentials application][]. If you have
   not logged in before, you must first **activate** your account.

   There are two steps,

   1. If there is no SSH key registered, you must add one.

   1. If there is already an SSH key registered, check the packages you
      have access to in the 'Profile' interface.

	You can alternatively check if you have access to your package
	using the command line

		  ssh -T git@git.bioconductor.org

	If you have access to your package, but cannot git `pull` or `push`,
	please check FAQ #13, #14, and #15.

1. I'm a developer for _Bioconductor_, my package `ExamplePackage` is on
   the new server https://git.bioconductor.org. What do I do next?

    Take a look at [Maintain GitHub and _Bioconductor_ repositories][].
	This will give you the information needed.

	NOTE: This situation is for packages which were previously
	maintained on SVN and have never been accessed through GIT. It is
	not for newly accepted packages through Github.

1. I have a GitHub repository already set up for my _Bioconductor_
   package at `www.github.com/<developer>/<ExamplePackage>` , how do I
   link my repository in GitHub and https://git.bioconductor.org ?

    Take a look at [New package workflow][]. Step 2 gives you
    information on how to add the remote and link both GitHub and
    _Bioconductor_ repositories.

1. I'm unable to `push` or `merge` my updates from my GitHub
   repository to my _Bioconductor_ package on
   `git@git.bioconductor.org`, how do I go about this?

    If you are unable to `push` or `merge` to either your GitHub
    account or _Bioconductor_ repository, it means you do not have the
    correct access rights. If you are a developer for _Bioconductor_,
    you will need to [submit your SSH public key][BiocCredentials application] to the
    [BiocCredentials][BiocCredentials application] app.

    You should also make sure to check that your public key is set up
    correctly on GitHub. Follow
    [Adding a new SSH key to your GitHub account][].

1. I'm not sure how to fetch the updates from `git.bioconductor.org`
   with regards to my package, how do I do this?

    Take a look at [Sync existing repositories][]. This will give you
    the information needed.

1. I'm just a package user, do I need to do any of this?

    As a package user, you do not need any of these __developer__
    related documentation. Although, it is a good primer if you want
    to be a contributor to _Bioconductor_.

    You can also open [Pull requests][] and [issues][Open github issue] on the
    _Bioconductor_ packages you use, __if__ they have a GitHub
    repository.

1. I'm new to git and GitHub, where should I learn?

    There are many resources where you can learn about git and GitHub.

    * [git-and-github-learning-resources][]
    * [git-scm][]
    * [Guides][gitguides]

1. I'm a _Bioconductor_ package maintainer, but I don't have access to
   the _Bioconductor_ server where my packages are being maintained. How
   do I gain access?

    Please submit your SSH public key using the [BiocCredentials][BiocCredentials application]
    app. Your key will be added to your our server and you will get
    read+ write access to your package.

    All developers of _Bioconductor_ packages are required to do this,
    if they don't already have access. Please identify which packages
    you need read/write access to in the email.

1. What is the relationship between the `origin` and `upstream` remote?

    In `git` lingo __origin__ is just the default name for a remote
    from which a repository was originally cloned. It might equally
    have been called by another name. We recommend that __origin__ be
    set to the developers GitHub repository.

    Similarly, __upstream__ is the name for a remote which is hosted
    on the _Bioconductor_ server.

    It is important that all the changes/updates you have on your
    __origin__ are equal to __upstream__, in other words, you want
    these two remotes to be in sync.

    Follow [Sync existing repositories][] for details on how to
    achieve this.

    Image explaining GitHub and _Bioconductor_ relationship for a
    developer

    ```{r,echo=FALSE}
    knitr::include_graphics("images/github-bioc-relationship.png")
    ```

1. Can I have more than one upstream remote, if yes, is this recommended?

    You can have as many remotes as you please. But you can have only
    one remote with the name __upstream__. We recommend having the
    remote `origin` set to GitHub, and `upstream` set to the
    _Bioconductor_ git server to avoid confusion.

1. Common names used in the scenario's

    `developer`: This should be your GitHub username, e.g., mine is
    `nturaga`.

    `BiocGenerics`: This is being used as an example to demonstrate
    git commands.

    `ExamplePackage`: This is being used a place holder for a package
    name.

    SVN `trunk` and git `master` branch are now the development
    branches.

1. I'm a _Bioconductor_ developer only on the _Bioconductor_ server. I do
    not have/want a GitHub account. What should I do?

    You do not have to get a Github account if you do not want
    one. But it is a really good idea, to maintain your package
    publicly and interact with the community via the social coding
    features available in Github.

    We highlight this in [Maintain a _Bioconductor_-only repository][]

1. I cannot push to my package. I get the error,

        $ git push origin master
        fatal: remote error: FATAL: W any packages/myPackage nobody DENIED by fallthru
        (or you mis-spelled the reponame)

    (you might have renamed the `origin` remote as `upstream`;
    substitute `upstream` for `origin`. Check your remote,

        $ git remote -v
        origin  https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/myPackage.git (fetch)
        origin  https://git.bioconductor.org/packages/myPackage.git (push)

    As a developer you should be using the SSH protocol, but the
    `origin` remote is HTTPS. Use

        git remote add origin git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage

    to change the remote to the SSH protocol. Note the `:` after the
    host name in the SSH protocol, rather than the `/` in the HTTPS
    protocol. Confirm that the remote has been updated correctly with
    `git remote -v`.

    If your remote is correct and you still see the message, then your
    SSH key is invalid. See the next FAQ.

1. Before sending a question to the Bioc-devel mailing list about
    git, please check the output of the following commands for
    correctness so that we can help you better.

    * As a developer check to make sure, you are using SSH as your
      access protocol.  Check the output of `git remote -v` for
      consistency. Include this in your email to bioc-devel, if you
      are unsure. The remote should look like,

            origin  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage.git (fetch)
            origin  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage.git (push)

       or

            origin  git@github.com:<github username>/myPackage.git (fetch)
            origin  git@github.com:<github username>/myPackage.git (push)
            upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage.git (fetch)
            upstream  git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage.git (push)

    * Check if you have access to the bioc-git server
      (git@git.bioconductor.org), by using `ssh -T
      git@git.bioconductor.org`.  This will show you a list of
      packages with READ(R) and WRITE(W) permissions.  As a developer
      you should have `R W` next to your package. This is based on the
      SSH public key you are using, the default for ssh authentication
      is `id_rsa`.

            R    	admin/..*
            R    	packages/..*
            R  	admin/manifest
            R  	packages/ABAData
            R  	packages/ABAEnrichment
            R  	packages/ABSSeq
            R W  	packages/ABarray
            R  	packages/ACME
            R  	packages/ADaCGH2
            R  	packages/AGDEX

1. SSH key not being recognized because of different name?

    If you have named your SSH public key differently from `id_rsa` as
    suggested by `ssh-keygen`, you may find it useful to set up a
    `~/.ssh/config` file on your machine.  Simply make a
    `~/.ssh/config` file if it does not exist, and add,

        host git.bioconductor.org
            HostName git.bioconductor.org
            IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa_bioconductor
            User git

    In this example, my private key is called `id_rsa_bioconductor`
    instead of `id_rsa`.

	You may find it useful to check the [BiocCredentials][BiocCredentials application] app to see
    what SSH key you have registered.

1. SSH key asking for a password and I don't know it? How do I
    retrieve it?

    There are a few possibilities here,

    * You have set a password. The bioc-devel mailing list cannot help
    you with this.  You have to submit a new key on the
    [BiocCredentials][BiocCredentials application] app.

    * The permissions on your SSH key are wrong. Verify that the
    permissions on SSH IdentityFile are `400`. SSH will reject, in a
    not clearly explicit manner, SSH keys that are too readable. It
    will just look like a credential rejection.  The solution, in this
    case, is (if your SSH key for bioconductor is called `id_rsa`):

            chmod 400 ~/.ssh/id_rsa

    * You have the wrong remote set up, please check `git remote -v`
    to make sure the SSH access protocol is being used. Your bioc-git
    server remote, should be
    `git@git.bioconductor.org:packages/myPackage`.

1. Can I create and push new branches to my repository on git.bioconductor.org?

    No. Maintainers only have access to `master` and the current `RELEASE_X_Y`.
    New branches cannot be created and pushed to the bioconductor server. We
    recommend maintainers have additional branches on their Github repository
    if they are maintaining one.

1. How can I fix my duplicate commits issue and find the required
    documentation?

	The detailed documentation to [resolve duplicate commits][]
	can be found at the link.
