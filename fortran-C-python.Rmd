# Fortran / C / C++ / Python / Third-Party Code {#other-than-Rcode}

If the package contains C or Fortran code, it should adhere to the standards and
methods described in the [System and foreign language interfaces][CRAN foreign]
section of the [Writing R Extensions][] manual.

##  Makevars

Make judicious use of the `Makevars` and `Makefile` files within a package.
These are often not required at all (See the [Configure and cleanup][CRAN
config] section of the [Writing R Extensions][] manual).

## Fortran {#fortran}

Consider utilizing the [dotCall64][] CRAN package. 

## C / C++ {#ccode}

The [Rcpp][] CRAN package allows seamless integration of C++ with `R`, and is
cross-platform. The package affords many of the same benefits for the
`R` C interface that make C++ so appealing as a language, while
eliminating many of the pitfalls of programming to the `R` interface.

The package is well documented, and has an extensive repository of
working examples for many tasks: the [Rcpp Gallery][].

## Python {#python}

The [basilisk][] package is encouraged to integrate python into R packages. Alternatively
[reticulate][] may be utilized but basilisk is preferred.  

## Other {#third-party-code}

Use of external libraries whose functionality is redundant with libraries
already supported is strongly discouraged.  In cases where the external library
is complex, the author may need to supply pre-built binary versions for some
platforms.

By including third-party code a package maintainer assumes responsibility for
maintenance of that code. Part of the maintenance responsibility includes
keeping the code up to date as bug fixes and updates are released for the
mainline third-party project.
